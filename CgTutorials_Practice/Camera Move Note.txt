Camera Move implement process:

>>(4h)analysis etViewer camera move;
>>(1.5day)review graphic pipeline;
>>implement math component(include matrix4x4, vector3)
>>understand Left Multiply and right Multiply;
>>understand Vector Rotate sequence  Z -> X -> Y axis, 
and understand why use mRotX and mRotY;

//just for camera control rotate style
//let z overlap, so z rotate not effective, 
//after rotate x first, because y axis is always updir, so rotate x not influence y rotate,
//but if you rotate y first, then rotate world x axis is not like rotate self x axis.
inline void OwnMatrix4x4::setPureRotateZXY(f32 radianX, f32 radianY, f32 radianZ)
{
	setPureRotateZ(radianZ);
	rotateX(radianX);
	rotateY(radianY);
}

>>defect:
-when implement a component, not know the aim clear, need true and clear plan;
-when implement a component, not over it directly, need time control;

Aim, Step, Condition, Time.
